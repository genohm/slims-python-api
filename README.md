## Getting Started

To get you started we provided a few cookbook examples:

### [Data Manipulation](cookbook/data-manipulation)

In this script, we demonstrate creating, modifying and removing content.


### [Flow Example](cookbook/flow-example)
Learn how to create a SLimsgate flow with python. In the given example you will create a very simple two steps flow. In the first step a content record can be selected in the UI. In the second step a new id
for that content record can be chosen.

### [Live Report](cookbook/live-report)
This web application is displaying on a web page a live report for a selected period. It shows how a webportal can be used to create a specific report directly through the api.

### [Order Submission](cookbook/order-submission)
In this sample web application, a user can create an order direclty through a web portal, with customizable appearance and formatting

### [Plotting](cookbook/plotting)
In this example, we demonstrate how graphical plots can be created with python while fetching the data through the api.
